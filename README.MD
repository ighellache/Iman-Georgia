So the idea so far:
-Marvel API
-Search superhero database 
-The story: you could be an agent of SHIELD or a villain 
and you want to find out more information about each character
-like their strenghts and weaknesses 
-put a cool background effect and music to pretend you have hacked into the system

We need two APIs so we will have a voice over-just like ultron

The comics will act as 'news articles' to know more about them
